# 📰 Multilingual Fake News Detection App

A **Streamlit web application** that detects whether a given news article is **Real** or **Fake** using Machine Learning models.
This app supports **English 🇬🇧, Hindi 🇮🇳, and Tamil 🇮🇳** with multilingual preprocessing, stopword removal, and ensemble-based predictions.

---

## ✨ Features

* 🌐 **Language Detection** – Automatically detects English, Hindi, or Tamil.
* 🔄 **Multilingual Preprocessing** – Cleans text and removes stopwords.
* 🤖 **Ensemble Prediction** – Uses Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and a Voting Classifier.
* 📊 **Confidence Score** – Shows probability-based confidence in predictions.
* 🧩 **Individual Model Insights** – Displays predictions from each model separately.
* ⚠️ **Disclaimer Section** – Educates users to verify information with official sources.
